### Picture this: Your team's drowning in data, but I'm the lifeguard who pulls out game-changing insights.

I've got the chops to make operations smoother and decisions smarter. At Macrotech, I automated inventory tracking with SQL and Power BI, slashing mismatches by 24 percent and boosting forecast accuracy by 21 percent. No more costly surprises in the supply chain.

At CruiseAlly, I spotted a 37 percent checkout drop-off using GA4 in Looker Studio, then built Django/GraphQL logic to cut zero-result searches by 28 percent. Suddenly, users found what they wanted, and the team had a clearer product roadmap.

Over at Indiana University, I launched a Flask-based GPT-4o chatbot that dropped policy lookup time from minutes to seconds. Staff saved hours weekly, all thanks to smart semantic search on 10,000+ records.

In research mode, I nailed a 94 percent match rate on massive IPO datasets with Python and Stata, uncovering a 17 percent lower layoff risk in founder-led firms. Processing time? Cut by 38 percent.

Even as an intern at TeknoBiz, I ramped up sales forecasting by 21 percent using Random Forest models in SAS/Python, and trimmed manual prep by 29 percent with T-SQL ETL. Excess inventory dropped 14 percent. Real results, real fast.

### Featured Projects: Proof I deliver

**NYC Taxi Revenue Analytics (Cloud + BI)**  
Imagine unlocking $810,000 in hidden revenue opportunities. I processed 150,000+ trip records via Mage-AI ETL on GCP, crafted fact-dimension schemas in BigQuery, and built auto-refreshing Looker Studio dashboards. Peak hours and credit trends (82 percent) jumped out, ready for smarter dispatching.  
**Tech:** Python, BigQuery, Google Cloud Scheduler, Looker Studio.

**Sales Performance Dashboards (Computer Hardware)**  
Who wants stale reports? I cleaned multi-dimensional sales data with SQL/Excel, then whipped up interactive Tableau dashboards for regional trends and margins. Stakeholders could drill down in seconds, spotting underperformers and boosting profitability insights by 17 percent in tests.  
**Tech:** SQL, Excel, Tableau.

**End-to-End Student Performance Prediction**  
Ever wish you could predict outcomes before they happen? I compared five ML algorithms (Random Forest won at 87 percent R²), built a Flask app, and deployed it on AWS/Azure with Docker. Instant predictions, scalable setup. Perfect for education or beyond.  
**Tech:** Python, Scikit-learn, Flask, Docker, AWS, Azure.
